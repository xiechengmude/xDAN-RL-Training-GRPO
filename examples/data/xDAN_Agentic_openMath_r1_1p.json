On the base plane of a cone with height $h$ and base radius $R$, a point (outside the cone) is given, which is at a distance of $aR$ from the circumference of the base. Find the angle between the tangent planes to the cone passing through the given point.\n\nFirst method:\n\nLet $L$ be the given point, $B$ and $C$ be the points of tangency of the planes with the circumference of the base, $\\varphi=\\angle B A O, \\psi=\\angle S A B, \\alpha=\\angle S A O$. The point $K$ is the intersection of the chord $B C$ and the line $A O$, where $O$ is the center of the base of the cone. Then $\\sin \\varphi=\\frac{B O}{O A}=\\frac{1}{a+1}$,\n\n$B A=R \\sqrt{a^{2}+2 a}, B K=R \\cos \\varphi=\\frac{R \\sqrt{a^{2}+2 a}}{a+1}, K A=B A \\cos \\varphi=\\frac{R\\left(a^{2}+2 a\\right)}{a+1}$.\nLet $S$ be the vertex of the cone. From the right triangle $\\triangle S O A$ we find $\\operatorname{tg} \\alpha=$ $\\frac{h}{(a+1) R}$. Therefore, $\\sin \\alpha=\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{h^{2}+(a+1)^{2} R^{2}}}$.

The Court.\n\nIn the language of the tribe inhabiting the island located not far from the island of zombies, the words \"bal\" and \"da\" mean \"yes\" and \"no,\" but words that sound the same do not necessarily have the same meaning. Some of the island's inhabitants answer questions with \"bal\" and \"da,\" while others, breaking an ancient taboo, prefer to speak English (and answer with \"yes\" and \"no\").\n\nFor some unexplained reasons, all members of any family on this island are of the same type. In particular, any two brothers are either both zombies or both humans.\n\nOne of the island's natives has been accused of treason. Given the particular importance of the case, it was decided to call Inspector Craig from London. The three main witnesses, A, B, and C, were natives of the island. The following excerpt is taken from the court transcript. The questioning of the witnesses is conducted by Inspector Craig.\n\nQuestion (to witness A). Is the defendant not guilty? Answer (from witness A). Bal.\n\nQuestion (to witness B). What does \"bal\" mean?\n\nAnswer (from witness B). \"Bal\" means \"yes.\"\n\nQuestion (to witness C). Are witnesses A and B brothers?\n\nAnswer (from witness C). No.\n\nSecond question (to witness C). Is the defendant not guilty?\n\nAnswer (from witness C).

It also turned out that there is a group of clients, each of whom has the same amount of money on their account. This amount is a number consisting of only ones. If you add up all the money on the accounts of this group of clients, the resulting sum will also be represented by a number consisting of only ones.

The center of this circle and some point on the circle are designated “known points”. Now she makes a series of moves, each of which takes one of the following forms:\n(i) She draws a line (infinite in both directions) between two “known points”; or\n(ii) She draws a circle whose center is a “known point” and which intersects another “known point”.\nOnce she makes a move, all intersections between her new line/circle and existing lines/circles become “known points”, unless the new/line circle is identical to an existing one. In other words, Anita is making a ruler-and-compass construction, starting from a circle.\nWhat is the smallest number of moves that Anita can use to construct a drawing containing an equilateral triangle inscribed in the original circle?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Once, for example, my dog, after waiting for me to go out, looked to see which way I was going to head, and when I started down the path, he raced to the end of it. Then he returned to me, ran to the end of the path again, and returned, and so on, doing this 4 times in total. All this time he moved at a constant speed, and when he ran to me for the last time, he covered the remaining distance of 81 m. Measuring the distance from my door to the end of the path later, I found it to be 625 m. At what speed did my dog run, if I was walking at a speed of 4 km/h?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

By gnawing through the walls, the mouse can move from a given small box to any adjacent one by a face (but not to those adjacent only by an edge or a vertex). What is the minimum number of holes in the walls of the boxes (of all sizes) that it will have to gnaw through to fulfill its dream?\n\nDescribe any path of the mouse with the minimum number of holes in the walls and calculate how many small boxes will have two opposite walls gnawed through in this case.\n\nNote.

Austin then chooses randomly from the remaining three numbers, and his first round score is the product of his second number and Joshua's first number. The process is repeated until each of the five numbers has been chosen. The sum of each player's two scores is their final score and the player with the highest final score wins.
